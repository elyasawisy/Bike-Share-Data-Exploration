# Bike-Share-Data-Exploration
A Python-based data analysis project exploring bike-share usage across three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Overview

This project uses Python to explore real bike-share datasets and uncover insights through descriptive statistics.
The program imports raw data, processes it using Pandas, and computes meaningful statistics related to user trips, stations, travel times, and demographics.

It also includes an interactive command-line application that allows users to filter the data by city, month, and day, and view insights instantly.

## Key Features

Load and analyze CSV datasets with Python

Compute descriptive statistics, including:

Most frequent travel times

Popular stations & routes

Trip duration trends

User demographics (when available)

Interactive terminal experience (city/month/day filters)

Option to display raw data in chunks

Clean, modular, and reusable code

## Tech Stack

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Terminal / CLI

## What I Learned
